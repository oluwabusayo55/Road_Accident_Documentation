### Project Title: Road Accident Analysis

### Project Overwiew
---
This project objective is to generate insights into road accidents and their drivers for 2021 and 2022. The project involved cleaning and processing the data, conducted exploratory analysis to identify trends and insights, creating visualizations of these insights which would enable me to make reasonable conclusions and recommendations from this data.

### Data Sources
---
The source of data used for this analysis is Road_Accident_Data which was provided in csv format and can be gotten from an open source online such as FRED or any data generation site.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel
   - Data Cleaning and Processing
   - Data Aanlaysis
   - Data Visualization
     
- Github for documnetation

### Data Cleaning and Processing 
---
In this phase, the following data cleaning and processing actions were done;
- Data loading and Inspection
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Handling duplicates and missing values
- Creation of new columns and introducing formulas for formatting
- Sorting and Filtering

### Data Analysis
---
During this phase, I did exploratory analysis by summarising the data to identify identify patterns and key insights. The analysis identified Monthly trends based on accidents, Casualties caused by Road Type and Road Surfaces, Casualties that occured based on locations, Casualties by Road Lighting Conditions and Casualties by Vehicle types through the use of Pivot tables. Key Insights Found Include;
- Fatal Casualties: 6,858 (1.2% of Total Casualties)
- Serious Casualties: 67,328 (12.2%)
- Slight Casualties: 475,901 (86.5%)
- Casualties Involving Cars: 438,611 (79.7%)
- Total Casualties: 550,087

This analysis highlights critical areas requiring attention to improve road safety and reduce casualty rates.

### Data Visualization
---
By leveraging visualizations, i was able to provide a clear view of the analysis performed on the data.

### Recommendations
---
From the observations gotten from the data, here are my recommendations;
- Invest in improving road conditions and deploy more safety officers to patrol urban areas which would mitigate high casualty rates.
- Install adequate and efficient lighting systems on roads, especially in high traffic areas to enhabce visiblity and reduce accidents.
- Despite the assumption that dry roads are safer, analysis indicates that accidents occur more on this roads. There should be implementation of speed limits, penalties for reckless driving  and raising driver awareness about the risks of high-speeding.
- Since single-way roads report the highest casualties, consideration should be made for redesigning wider lanes and pedestrian crossings.
- Cars account for the hgihest number of casualties. There should be stricter implementation of traffic laws for car drivers and encourage the use of advanced safety technologies like collision avoidance systems in Vehicles.
